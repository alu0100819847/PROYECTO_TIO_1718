The codes in RISC programs consist of fewer instructions than their CISC equivalents
The RISC philosophy is founded on the priciple that in order to improve the computerÂ´s performance it is necessary to minimize the number of clock cycles needed to execute instructions
RISC Architecture indicates that increasing the addressing modes allows data to be more easily accessed, and as such, makes execution times faster.
RISC defends data dependences, in the pipeline processors these must be resolved by the hardware due to it being faster
